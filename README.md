I completed the assignment today. Throughout the assignment I did the following.
-Created objects for each store and filled them with properties. One of which was a function that calculates a random number of customers per hour.
-Next I created two arrays. One holds each store name and the other holds business hours for the stores.
-The next step was making a nested for loop. The first statement cycles through the stores and finds the random number of cookie sales and stores the data in a new object property that we later document in the HTML document. The second loop goes through the hours of business and finds a random number for each hour.
-Then I used document.getElementById to print the outcome.
-I added css styling to my page.
